Can we use Dr. TongTong theory to enhance wireless connectivity?
That is wireless card with multiple antennas are available around, and we can make two radios share the same symbol period; that is two radios transmit symbols within the same symbol period.

Can we make an AP sense low voltage level signals? that is if a vehicle goes far then the received signal is of lower power; this might limit the coverage unless we do finegrain sensing..
