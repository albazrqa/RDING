Can we use Dr. TongTong theory to enhance wireless connectivity?
That is wireless card with multiple antennas are available around, and we can make two radios share the same symbol period; that is two radios transmit symbols within the same symbol period.

Can we make an AP sense low voltage level signals? that is if a vehicle goes far then the received signal is of lower power; this might limit the coverage unless we do finegrain sensing..

there is a problem with FFT and GFSK demodulation, how to fix this issue? about other modulation techniques? how to come up with a general radio that can work with all wireless technologies, like BT, BLE, WiFi, Zigbee, etc.. ? It seems alot of work here..
Can we use a software to decode signals from different technologies? We may need to small hardware components to detect headers of pkts, then pkts payload can be treated with software after ADCs..
How to explore FFT domain to solve problems in wireless?
