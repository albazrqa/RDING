Some writing highlights for implementation..

1- Implementation is different from design.. Impl is related to the platform or how we impl a specific design.. When the platform is changed then the implementation details are changed..

2- In the implementation, we plot a comprehensive block diagram to show the entire system blocks and how they cooperate, what msgs the exchange.. What is the sequence of msgs.. And these things..

Then when we describe the system, we do it in an abstract way.. Like x takes CLK and computes subchannel index.. Our we describe, sequence of event execution or sequence of tasks execution..

The structure of implementation should be built in a logical way; and also it should be consistent..
